# Stoa

> The painted porch for AI memory.

AI agents have session amnesia — every conversation rediscovers what the previous one already knew.
Stoa fixes this with a compounding markdown wiki, a hybrid recall layer, and automatic injection back
into the agent's context, all captured passively through platform hooks without changing how you work.
The market has shipped fragments (wiki tools without recall, memory tools without synthesis); Stoa is
the first to combine all three with honest benchmarks and a sustainable OSS posture.

## How it works

Three layers, each independently useful:

- **Wiki** (`wiki/`, `raw/`, `sessions/`) — plain markdown on disk. Human-readable, Obsidian-compatible,
  git-trackable. The canonical store; everything else is derived from it. If Stoa disappeared tomorrow,
  your files stay.
- **Recall** (`.stoa/recall.db`, `.stoa/vectors/`) — hybrid index over the wiki and session transcripts:
  vector embeddings + BM25 (SQLite FTS5) + a small typed knowledge graph. Behind a formal `RecallBackend`
  trait so the substrate is swappable. Fully rebuildable with `stoa rebuild`.
- **Capture + injection** — a deterministic agent-platform hook captures session transcripts into a SQLite
  queue in <10 ms. Async workers handle redaction, harvest, and crystallization off the agent's hot path.
  At session boot, Stoa injects the top-K relevant wiki pages into the agent's context automatically.

                              ▼
               Harvest worker  ──►  wiki/ (entities, concepts, synthesis)
                              │
                              ▼
            Recall index (BM25 + vectors + KG)
                              │
                              ▼
         SessionStart hook  ──►  top-K wiki pages injected into context
```

> The repo skeleton and capture pipeline are in place. The walking skeleton (v0.1) is in progress.
>
> | What ships in v0.1 | What comes later |
> |---|---|
> | `stoa init`, `stoa query`, `stoa ingest`, `stoa note` | Harvest + crystallize workers (v0.2) |
> | Claude Code `Stop` hook capture + PII redaction | Cursor / Codex adapters (v0.3) |
> | `LocalChromaSqliteBackend` (vector + BM25 + KG) | MCP wrapper (v0.3) |
> | SessionStart injection with MINJA-resistant delimiters | UserPromptSubmit / PreCompact injection (v0.2) |

## Install

**Pre-release (current):**

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/marcoskichel/stoa stoa-cli
```

**Stable (once v0.1 ships):**

```bash
cargo install stoa-cli
```

The Python sidecar (harvest, crystallize, embeddings) is an implementation detail — it bootstraps
automatically via `uv` on the first `stoa daemon` run. No manual sidecar management required.

**Platforms:** Linux x86\_64 / aarch64 · macOS x86\_64 / aarch64 · Windows x86\_64

## Quickstart

```bash
# Scaffold a Stoa workspace in your project directory
stoa init

# Register the Claude Code capture + injection hooks
stoa hook install --platform claude-code --inject session-start

# Start the background worker (capture → redact → queue)
stoa daemon &

# Use Claude Code normally. After a session ends, query what was captured:
stoa query "what did we decide about auth"

# Verify what was injected into your last session
stoa inject log
```

After a few sessions, Stoa accumulates a `wiki/` of entities and decisions your agent sessions have
touched. `stoa query` searches across wiki pages and session transcripts with hybrid recall (vector + BM25).
`stoa inject log` shows exactly which pages were prepended to the system prompt and why.

## What's in the OSS core (MIT)

- **`stoa init`** — scaffold workspace (`STOA.md`, `wiki/`, `raw/`, `sessions/`, `.stoa/`, `.gitignore`)
- **`stoa hook install`** — register capture and injection hooks for Claude Code (Cursor and Codex in v0.3)
- **`stoa daemon`** — run capture + harvest + scheduler workers
- **`stoa ingest`** — ingest URLs, PDFs, markdown, plain text into `raw/`
- **`stoa query`** — hybrid search across wiki + sessions (any agent, any shell)
- **`stoa inject log`** — inspect what was injected into recent sessions and why
- **`stoa harvest`** / **`stoa crystallize`** — manual triggers for distillation stages (automated in v0.2)
- **`stoa lint`** — wiki health check
- **`stoa note`** — add a structured observation to the active session (agent or human)
- **`stoa rebuild`** — regenerate all of `.stoa/` from `wiki/` + `sessions/` + `raw/`
- `LocalChromaSqliteBackend` as the default recall substrate; formal `RecallBackend` trait for community adapters
- Rule-based PII and secret redaction at capture and ingest; MINJA-resistant XML delimiters on every injection
- Always-flush on session exit — no `SAVE_INTERVAL` gate, no silent data loss
- Reproducible benchmark suite (LongMemEval, MemoryAgentBench, MEMTRACK, BEAM, AgentLeak) with published per-backend results
- Local-first — no required cloud, no required API keys

**Paid layer (planned, not promised):** sync, team shared brain, hosted instance, audit log.
The OSS core stays MIT and stays useful by itself.

## Benchmarks

The benchmark suite spec and corpus details are in [benchmarks/README.md](./benchmarks/README.md).
Results land here when v0.1 ships, pinned to the exact commit they were generated from.

No placeholder numbers. Several projects in this space (mempalace, wiki-recall) published fabricated
or retroactively stripped numbers; the published suite exists to make that impossible here.
